This implementation introduces Redis caching to the API endpoint :

1. **Redis Client Setup:**
   - Creates a Redis client using the connection URL from environment variables
   - Promisifies Redis methods for use with async/await
   - Includes error handling for Redis connection issues

2. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Generates a cache key for the products endpoint
   - Checks the cache before querying the database
   - Returns cached data immediately when available

3. **Cache Management:**
   - Sets a 5-minute (300 seconds) expiration time using the 'EX' parameter
   - This ensures data is automatically refreshed periodically
   - Prevents stale data issues while still benefiting from caching

4. **Logging:**
   - Logs cache hits and misses for monitoring performance
   - Includes error logging for troubleshooting



This implementation will significantly reduce database load for frequently accessed data while ensuring users still see relatively fresh data with the 5-minute expiration window.
