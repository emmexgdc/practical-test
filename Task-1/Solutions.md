The error messages "MongoDB connection failed" and "MongooseError: connect ECONNREFUSED" indicate that the application cannot establish a connection to the MongoDB database. This can caused by:

1. Incorrect connection string in the environment variables
2. Network restrictions (IP whitelisting) preventing Render from connecting to MongoDB Atlas
3. Missing environment variables on Render

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Verify your MongoDB Atlas connection string

First I will collaborate with the backend engineer to ensure we are using the correct MongoDB Atlas connection string format in the `.env` file:


### 2. Update IP whitelisting in MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas by default blocks connections from unknown IP addresses:

1. Log in to the MongoDB Atlas account
2. Go to Network Access in the Security section
3. Add a new IP address entry
4. Use `0.0.0.0/0` to allow connections from anywhere (for development/testing only) or add Render's IP ranges
5. Click "Confirm" and wait for the changes to take effect (can take a few minutes)

### 3. I will ensure environment variables are set in Render

1. Log in to the Render dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Go to the "Environment" tab
4. Add or update the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable with the connection string
5. Make sure there are no spaces or extra characters in the connection string

### 4. Update the MongoDB connection code

I will work with the backend Engineer to ensure the MongoDB connection code handles connection errors properly:


### 5. Restart the Render service

After making these changes:

1. i will go back to the "Dashboard" or "Overview" tab in Render
2. Click the "Manual Deploy" button and select "Clear build cache & deploy"
3. Monitor the deployment logs for any remaining errors
